# SkinCancer
Using data from ISIC, I detect the type of skin cancer using pictures and metadata along with machine learning.
The link for the data is here: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2019/
Some of the python code is designed to only use the pictures provided in the ISIC repository but some of them are designed to use both the pictures and the metadata to see if there will be an imporvement on the accuracy of the model.
I focused on three different models to see their differences, VGG16, VGG19 and CNN.
This research project was inspired by reading a paper by Professor Trappenberg whose paper I have also included in the my repository. I wrote a small research paper including my techniques and findings which I have also included in this repository.
